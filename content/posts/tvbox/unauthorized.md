When playing a video on your TV Box, you may encounter an error message that says `Unauthorized Playback`.

This error occurs when you're trying to play a video on Jellyfin but are logged into the wrong account and the owner did not provide fingerprint access to authorize playback.

To prevent this issue from happening, please use your brain and check the playback history. If it looks incorrect, you might be logged into the wrong account. When this error shows up, the system will automatically log you out, and you'll need to log back in with the correct account.
