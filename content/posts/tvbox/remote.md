**Samsung TV Remote**

This remote is used to turn on the Samsung TV and control the volume. If the Problematics Box R 4K Plus remote is not working, turning the TV on using this remote could revive the TV Box.

**Pioneer AVR Remote**

This remote is the most reliable remote to control the volume of the sound system and additional sound settings. Use this if other remotes are not working with CEC.
