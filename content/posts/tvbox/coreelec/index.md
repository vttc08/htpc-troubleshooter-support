## Using CoreELEC
CoreELEC is based on Kodi, it will be play to playback any files that are not supported on Android. First, login to the correct account. Since the automatic reboot is not implemented yet, you will need to find the movie that you are having problem with manually.

> [!error] Android TV Remote does not work
> In CoreELEC, the Android TV remote will not work, you'll need to use the Samsung TV Remote or the Logitech K400 keyboard (connect it via USB) to navigate the system. See [here](../remote) for all the remotes.

## Alternative: Use a laptop
> [!warning] Windows and Dolby Vision
> In Windows, Dolby Vision is not supported, and any DoVi files regardless of P7 FEL or not will be displayed as regular HDR. Additionally, HDR10+ is not also not supported. These files are best played on CoreELEC. However, if you are unable to use CoreELEC or prefer the versatility of Windows, you can use a laptop to play the files.

Will be implemented later.
