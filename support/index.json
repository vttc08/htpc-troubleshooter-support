It is likely the subtitle is not enabled in the video player. This page will guide you through the process of enabling Chinese subtitles in Jellyfin.\nSubtitle Formats For the purpose of documentation, the Chinese subtitles will come in the following forms\nInternal Subtitles These are subtitles that are already embedded in the video file. There are several formats such as\nSubRip (.srt) Advanced SubStation Alpha Graphic Subtitle Format (.PGS) Some of the videos already have Chinese subtitles, and it will be displayed as Chinese (Simplified). These subtitles usually have only one language.\nExternal Subtitles These are subtitles that are provided as separate files from the video. These are downloaded manually. In most up to date movies, 2 types of Chinese subtitles are provided\nMultiple languages (mul) - 中英文字幕 Simplified Chinese (chi) - 中文字幕 To enable the subtitles that are already present, follow the steps below\nJust Player Just Player is the default player on Android due to its compatibility and lesser crashes.

Due to the closed source nature of Android TV, the troubleshooter is not able to diagnose or fix the issue. Follow the steps below to fix the issue.\nLocal Playback Since the playback will always occur over the LAN for now, buffering due to lack of bandwidth is very unlikely to occur. You may have been mistaken the cause of the issue.\nLong Time to Load Media in the Beginning Some movies are stored on the archival HDD which is kept spun down most of the time to save power. The HDD will need to spin up before the movie can be played. This type of buffering normal behavior and not a network issue.\nAudio Stutter, Video Freeze For some media files, specifically DTS-HD MA audio, it\u0026rsquo;s likely you\u0026rsquo;ll experience audio or video freezing or stuttering. This is due to the Problematics Box R 4K Plus in Android and it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to fix, there is nothing wrong with the network bandwidth. If this is bothering you, you can try to play the media using CoreELEC for a flawless playback experience.\nRemote Playback This is reserved for future use. In case when the server is moved to another location and the playback is done remotely, buffering may occur due to the lack of bandwidth. However, due to the closed source nature of Android TV, the troubleshooter is not able to diagnose or fix the issue. But you can try to diagnose manually.\nSince the troubleshooter runs on the same machine as the Jellyfin server, it will be able to perform some basic checks to see if the server is reachable from the internet and the network bandwidth is sufficient. Run the tests below to diagnose the issue.\nDebug Internet Connection on Server NOT IMPLEMENTED YET\n","permalink":"https://htpc-troubleshooter-support.pages.dev/support/posts/av/networking/buffering/","summary":"How to network buffering issues on your during media playback.","title":"Network Buffering"},{"content":"You may be asked to visit this documentation page if you are experiencing issues with no sound on your Onkyo/Pioneer receiver.
